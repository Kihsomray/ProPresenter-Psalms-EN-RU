# Psalm Offsets - Russian & English for ProPresenter
ProPresenter Library for the book of Psalms. Parallel - English Standard Version &amp; Russian Synodal Translation.

### Why?
We have attempted to contact ProPresenter with this issue for some time. Unfortunately, they were unable to provide a fix. This library aims at fixing these offsets.

Bible verses remain the same. The only thing that is changed from the standard ProPresenter Bible setup are the offsets.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo to Macintosh HD⁩ ▸ ⁨Users⁩ ▸ ⁨&lt;user&gt;⁩ ▸ ⁨Documents⁩ ▸ ⁨ProPresenter⁩ ▸ Documents. The library will appear the next time you open ProPresenter.
2. Apply a theme that you use with the standard Bible.
3. Stay up to date. Offsets may be updated with more accurate information.
