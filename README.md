### Why?
We have attempted to contact ProPresenter with this issue for some time. Unfortunately, they were unable to provide a fix. This library aims at fixing these offsets.

Bible verses remain the same. The only thing that is changed from the standard ProPresenter Bible setup are the offsets.

## How to Use
1. Download the latest release.
2. Un-zip the content.
3. Move the Psalms folder to your Library folder. By default:
    - **On MacOS:** Macintosh HD⁩ ▸ ⁨Users⁩ ▸ ⁨&lt;user&gt;⁩ ▸ ⁨Documents⁩ ▸ ⁨ProPresenter⁩ ▸ Documents.
4. Open ProPresenter. Ensure the library has successfully been added.

6. Stay up to date. Offsets may be updated with more accurate information.

## Progress
All Psalm chapters have been completed.
